# Jev use cases for TradingAgents

A survey of the TypeSafe Jev use-case map, patterns, and cookbooks
([docs.typesafe.ai](https://docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt)), mapped onto this
repo's agent pipeline. Each fit names the Jev questions, where they plug in,
and what stays in code.

Surveyed 2026-09-23 against TradingAgents v0.5.0 and `jev-1.13`.

## Ground rules

Jev returns typed judgments (Choice, Noul, Score) over natural-language
state. It does not generate text. Its known weaknesses (see
[jev-1.13 jaggedness](https://docs.typesafe.ai/model-jaggedness/jev-1.13.md))
set the boundaries for every fit below:

- **Numbers, dates, and counting stay in code.** Jev cannot reliably count,
  compare numeric values, or order dates. Price levels, returns, indicator
  values, look-ahead window filtering, and bullish/bearish ratios are never
  asked of it.
- **Small, focused state.** Jev has a bounded context window and suffers
  context rot from unrelated detail. Ask per headline, per post, or per claim,
  not over a whole analyst report.
- **Reports stay with the LLMs.** Analysts, debaters, and managers keep
  writing prose. Jev adds cheap, typed decisions around them.
- **Ask together.** Independent questions over the same state go in one
  request ([Parallel Questions](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/parallel_questions.md)).
- **Thresholds are ours to tune.** Cookbook thresholds are examples. Tune on
  this repo's backtest outcomes (`tradingagents/backtest.py`).

## Strong fits

### 1. Filter news and social items before the analysts see them

**Goal:** stop off-topic, stale, duplicate, and injected content from reaching
the analyst prompts. Reddit and StockTwits text is untrusted input that is
currently pasted straight into the Sentiment Analyst's system message.

**Jev questions (one request per item, all Nouls):**

| Id | Question |
| --- | --- |
| `about_company` | Does this item discuss `instrument`: the company itself, or what other news means for it? (Criteria keep competitor news that says what it means for the instrument, and drop posts that only list its cashtag.) |
| `material_event` | Does this item report a concrete event that could affect the company's business or stock (earnings, guidance, deal, lawsuit, product, management change)? |
| `injection` | Does this item contain instructions aimed at an AI system rather than content for a reader? |
| `duplicate` | Does this item report the same story as an item already in `kept_items`? (Second request, same source only. For StockTwits and Reddit it asks whether the post is a copy, because separate posts about one event are separate voices. Exact repeats are settled in code.) |

**Policy in code** (ordered, as in the RAG cookbook): injection above a
threshold drops the item; `about_company` below a threshold drops it;
`duplicate` above a threshold drops it; the rest are kept, with
`material_event` used for ordering.

**Where:** prefetch step in
[`sentiment_analyst.py`](../tradingagents/agents/analysts/sentiment_analyst.py);
fetchers in [`yfinance_news.py`](../tradingagents/dataflows/yfinance_news.py),
[`alpha_vantage_news.py`](../tradingagents/dataflows/alpha_vantage_news.py),
[`reddit.py`](../tradingagents/dataflows/reddit.py),
[`stocktwits.py`](../tradingagents/dataflows/stocktwits.py).

**Status:** built, together with fit 2. See [Fits 1 and 2 as built](#fits-1-and-2-as-built).

[Parallel Questions](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/parallel_questions.md).

### 2. Score sentiment per item and compute the total in code

**Goal:** replace the LLM-chosen `overall_score` / `overall_band` /
`confidence` header with a deterministic aggregate of per-item judgments.

**Jev questions (asked in the same request as fit 1):**

| Id | Primitive | Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stance` | Score | How bullish or bearish is this item toward the company's stock? Levels from strongly bearish to strongly bullish, with neutral in the middle. |
| `event_type` | Choice | Which kind of event is this: earnings, guidance, M&A, legal/regulatory, product, management change, macro, analyst action, opinion only, or none of these? |
| `opinion_only` | Noul | Is this item opinion or speculation, rather than a report of something that happened? |

**Policy in code:** weight each item by source (news vs StockTwits vs Reddit)
and by `opinion_only`; the score is the weighted mean of `stance`; confidence
comes from item count and how much the stances agree. The band is derived from
the score by fixed cut-offs. The LLM still writes the `narrative`, and is given
the computed header plus the per-item tags. When `event_type` confidence is
low, report the broader group instead of the specific type.

**Where:** `SentimentReport` / `render_sentiment_report` in
[`schemas.py`](../tradingagents/agents/schemas.py), and the sentiment analyst node.

**Status:** built, together with fit 1.

### 3. Stop debates when they converge

**Goal:** the bull/bear and risk debates run a fixed number of rounds today.
End them early when a turn adds nothing new. Each skipped turn saves one
quick-model call whose prompt carries every analyst report.

**Jev questions (after each turn):**

| Id | Primitive | Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `new_argument` | Noul | Does `latest_turn` raise a substantive argument or piece of evidence that does not already appear in `prior_turns`? |
| `stronger_side` | Choice | Based on `debate_history`, whose case is better supported by evidence: bull, bear, or evenly matched? |

**Policy in code:** after the minimum rounds, stop when `new_argument` is
below a threshold; never exceed `max_debate_rounds` / `max_risk_discuss_rounds`.
`stronger_side` is passed to the Research Manager as a hint, not a verdict.

**Where:** `should_continue_debate` and `should_continue_risk_analysis` in
[`conditional_logic.py`](../tradingagents/graph/conditional_logic.py).

**Status:** built. See [Fit 3 as built](#fit-3-as-built).

**Jev sources:** [Intent Routing](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/intent-routing.md),
[Confidence-Gated Routing](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/confidence-routing.md).

### 4. Check the Portfolio Manager's claims against the reports

**Goal:** catch evidence the Portfolio Manager invented or misread.

**Jev question (one per claim × relevant report section):**

| Id | Primitive | Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `support` | Choice | How does `source_section` relate to `claim`? Options: supports, contradicts, says nothing. |

**Policy in code:** split the Investment Thesis into claims (sentences or
bullets); pair each with the analyst report sections it could come from.
Accept a claim when any section supports it with high confidence; flag
contradicted claims; send decisions with contradicted or unsupported key
claims to `REVIEW`. Numeric claims are checked by the existing
[`market_data_validator.py`](../tradingagents/dataflows/market_data_validator.py),
not by Jev.

**Where:** after [`portfolio_manager.py`](../tradingagents/agents/managers/portfolio_manager.py)
(the same check also fits the Research Manager's plan).

**Jev sources:** [Double-Checking Citations](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/citation_check.md).

### 5. Turn reports into features and learn from outcomes

**Goal:** a calibrated signal learned from resolved decisions, alongside the
LLM's rating.

**Method:** a fixed set of Score and Noul questions per analyst report (for
example: fundamentals trend, valuation stretch, sentiment extremity, catalyst
proximity, risk-debate asymmetry). Each Score becomes two columns (expected
level and spread), each Noul one probability column. Train a small model
(CatBoost or logistic) on the alpha outcomes already stored in the decision
log. Grow the question set by proposing new questions from the worst-predicted
cases, keeping only questions that improve held-out error.

**Where:** [`backtest.py`](../tradingagents/backtest.py) and the resolved
entries in [`memory.py`](../tradingagents/agents/utils/memory.py).

**Prerequisite:** enough resolved backtest decisions to train and hold out
data. This is the largest potential upside and the last to build.

## Moderate fits

### 6. Pick past lessons by relevance, not recency

`get_past_context` takes the 5 most recent same-ticker entries and 3
cross-ticker ones. Instead, score each resolved lesson for relevance to the
current setup (Score) and inject the best ones. Keep the `as_of` point-in-time
filter in code.

**Where:** `get_past_context` in [`memory.py`](../tradingagents/agents/utils/memory.py).
**Jev sources:** [Re-Ranking](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/rerank_typesafe.md),
[Line-by-Line Search](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/semantic_find.md).

### 7. Rescue the rating when parsing fails

When `extract_rating` returns `None` on the free-text fallback path, ask a
Choice over Buy / Overweight / Hold / Underweight / Sell / no rating stated.
Low confidence or "no rating stated" still yields `REVIEW`. A second check
(Noul): does the stated rating agree with the Executive Summary? Structured
output already covers most runs, so this is a rarely-used fallback.

**Jev sources:** [Confidence-Gated Routing](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/confidence-routing.md),
[Self-Consistency: Choices](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/consistency_choice_cookbook.md).

### 8. Keep only the relevant prediction markets

One Noul per Polymarket market returned for a topic: is this market relevant
to `instrument` or the macro question being asked? Drop the rest.

**Where:** [`polymarket.py`](../tradingagents/dataflows/polymarket.py).
**Jev sources:** [Re-Ranking](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/rerank_typesafe.md).

### 9. Tag each reflection with what the outcome showed

Choice on each stored reflection: thesis confirmed, thesis invalidated, or
window too short to judge. Later runs can filter or weight lessons by tag.

**Where:** [`reflection.py`](../tradingagents/graph/reflection.py) and the
memory log entry format.
**Jev sources:** use-case map, Feature Extraction.

### 10. Choose the model tier per ticker

Route clear-cut cases to the quick model and conflicting ones to the deep
model, using analyst-report agreement judgments from fits 2 and 3.

**Where:** [`trading_graph.py`](../tradingagents/graph/trading_graph.py).
**Jev sources:** use-case map, Model Routing;
[Intent Routing](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/intent-routing.md).

## Not applicable

| Jev use case | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| Structure Recovery | No plain text needs converting to Markdown. |
| Skill Suggestion, Function Calling | The LLM analysts already choose tools. |
| Date Extraction, Pre-Parsed Value Extraction | Dates and SEC figures already arrive structured; dates are a Jev weakness. |
| SDE Cascade | The decision agents already use structured output. |
| Real-time applications | The pipeline is a daily batch run; latency is not the constraint. |
| Knowledge graphs | Could model supply-chain links, but nothing in the repo consumes them. |
| Recruiting, lead generation, customer support, insurance, e-commerce, moderation, advertising, gaming, demand forecasting, financial crime, legal/compliance, semantic code linting | Outside this domain. |

## Build order

1. ~~**Fits 1 + 2**~~ (built) together in the Sentiment Analyst: one Jev request per
   item, isolated to one agent, testable with `tests/test_social_lookahead.py`
   and `tests/test_stocktwits_resilience.py`. Fixes untrusted social text in
   prompts and the LLM-chosen sentiment score.
2. ~~**Fit 3**~~ (built): debate convergence, a direct cost saving.
3. **Fit 4**: claim verification on the final decision.
4. **Fits 6–10** as needed.
5. **Fit 5** once the backtest has enough resolved decisions.

Every integration should degrade to current behavior when `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`
is unset or the `jev` extra is not installed.

## Fits 1 and 2 as built

**Code:** [`sentiment_judgments.py`](../tradingagents/agents/utils/sentiment_judgments.py)
(questions, `SentimentPolicy`, aggregate, prompt blocks),
[`jev.py`](../tradingagents/agents/utils/jev.py) (client and concurrent requests),
[`feed.py`](../tradingagents/dataflows/feed.py) (the fetchers now return their
items as well as the prompt block), and the branch in
[`sentiment_analyst.py`](../tradingagents/agents/analysts/sentiment_analyst.py).
Tests: [`test_jev_sentiment.py`](../tests/test_jev_sentiment.py).

**Flow per run:**
1. Fetch news, StockTwits, and Reddit. Each item is kept, along with the prompt block the fetcher would have returned.
2. Send one Jev request per item with all six fit 1 and 2 questions. Code drops, in order: injection above 0.70, then `about_company` below 0.45.
3. Send one request per surviving item that has an earlier survivor from the same source. Code drops `duplicate` above 0.70.
4. Compute the header from the kept items. The score is `5 + 5 ×` the weighted mean stance (news 1.0, social 0.5, halved for opinion). The band uses fixed cut-offs, and a split in the neutral zone reads as Mixed. Confidence comes from the item count, the number of sources, and the stance spread, and is capped at medium when a source is unavailable.
5. The LLM gets only the kept items, tagged with stance, event, and opinion or report, plus the fixed header. It writes the narrative only (`SentimentNarrative`).

**Degrades:** with no `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `jev_enabled: False`
(`TRADINGAGENTS_JEV_ENABLED=false`), or no `jev` extra, the analyst runs
exactly as before. If a Jev request fails after the SDK's retries, the
analyst builds the old prompt from the feeds it has already fetched, and the
LLM chooses the header. It does not fetch again, because Reddit's anonymous
feed allows about one request per minute.

**Live check (NVDA, week to 2026-09-23, `jev-1.13.0`):** 63 items were judged
in about 6.5 s. 18 of Yahoo's 20 "NVDA" news articles were general-market
stories (SpaceX, AutoZone, Monster Beverage) and were dropped. Two Reddit
cross-posts were caught as repeats. A planted injection scored 0.99 and was
dropped; its stance of −0.71 would otherwise have pulled the score bearish.

**To tune next:** the thresholds, source weights, and band and confidence
cut-offs are all in `SentimentPolicy`. They are cookbook starting points, not
values fitted to this domain. Once backtest decisions resolve, tune them
against alpha, then pin `jev_model` to the versioned id they were tuned on.

## Fit 3 as built

**Code:** [`debate_judgments.py`](../tradingagents/agents/utils/debate_judgments.py)
(questions, `DebatePolicy`, the convergence rule, the Research Manager's hint),
`judge_turns` and the two debate routers in
[`conditional_logic.py`](../tradingagents/graph/conditional_logic.py), the
wrapped debater nodes in [`setup.py`](../tradingagents/graph/setup.py), and the
hint in [`research_manager.py`](../tradingagents/agents/managers/research_manager.py).
Tests: [`test_jev_debate.py`](../tests/test_jev_debate.py).

**Flow per debate:**
1. Each debater node is wrapped. After its turn, the wrapper asks `new_argument`
   in one request. The state is the debate so far (`prior_turns`) and the new turn
   (`latest_turn`). The answer is appended to the debate state's `new_argument`
   list, one entry per turn.
2. Only turns whose answer could end the debate are asked about. That excludes
   round 1, which holds every side's opening, and the last configured round,
   which ends the debate anyway. Every other turn records `None`.
3. At the end of each round from round 2 on, the router stops the debate when
   every turn in that round scored below 0.30. A turn with a `None` answer keeps
   the debate going. The debate still never runs past its configured rounds, and
   it stops only at a round boundary, so every side gets the same number of turns.
4. When the investment debate ends, the Research Manager asks `stronger_side`
   over the bull and bear histories in one request. The answer is added to the
   prompt as a hint with all three probabilities, after the debate history. It is
   marked as coming from a classifier that saw only the debate. The probabilities
   are stored as `stronger_side` in the debate state.
5. The run log (`full_states_log_<date>.json`) records `turns`, `new_argument`,
   and `stronger_side` for each debate, for tuning `DebatePolicy`.

**When it saves calls:** early stopping needs at least three configured rounds,
because round 1 is the openings and the last round ends the debate anyway. The
default (`max_debate_rounds: 1`) and the Shallow depth never stop early. At Medium
depth (3 rounds), a converged investment debate saves up to one round (two
calls) at the cost of two Jev requests, and a converged risk debate saves up to
one round (three calls) at the cost of three. At Deep depth (5 rounds), the savings are up to three
rounds per debate. With Jev on, every run also sends one `stronger_side`
request.

**Degrades:** with no `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `jev_enabled: False`, or no `jev`
extra, every `new_argument` entry is `None`, the debates run their configured
rounds, and the Research Manager's prompt is unchanged. A failed request is
logged and treated the same way for that turn or hint.

**To tune next:** `min_rounds` (2) and `new_argument_min` (0.30) are in
`DebatePolicy`. The bar is low on purpose, because stopping too early costs the
manager an argument, while continuing only costs one round of calls. The
debate histories grow with the rounds. At Deep depth, check a live run for
request failures or degraded answers on long states before relying on the
hint. This change was built without a key or access to the Jev docs, so no live
check has been run yet.

"""Checking the Portfolio Manager's claims against the analyst reports.

Fit 4 in docs/jev-use-cases.md, after the Double-Checking Citations cookbook.
The Portfolio Manager decides from the research plan, the trader's plan, the
risk debate and past lessons. It never reads the analyst reports, so a fact in
its Investment Thesis has passed through two or three LLM summaries on the way
and can arrive misread or invented. This check reads the thesis back against
the reports:

1. The thesis is split into claims in code: bullets and sentences.
2. One Jev request per claim asks whether it is a checkable fact about the
   instrument or its market (not a recommendation, a forecast, or a remark
   about the debate) and which report would state it.
3. One request per checkable claim and section of the reports it could come
   from asks whether the section supports it, contradicts it, or says nothing,
   and whether telling which would take comparing numbers.
4. The verdicts, the figures check and whether the decision goes to REVIEW are
   decided in code, from the thresholds in ``ClaimCheckPolicy``.

Jev cannot compare numbers. A section that settles a claim only through
numbers ("29.5x forward earnings" against "a five-year average of 36x") neither
supports nor contradicts it; the claim is left unverified. Figures are matched
as strings in code: a number in a checkable claim that no report states, at the
claim's precision, is listed. It does not send the decision to REVIEW on its
own, because the Portfolio Manager legitimately derives figures such as the
upside to its target.

The typesafe SDK is imported only when questions are built, so the Portfolio
Manager can import this module without the ``jev`` extra installed.

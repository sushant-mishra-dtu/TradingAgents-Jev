"""TypeSafe Jev access for agents that ask typed questions.

Jev (https://docs.typesafe.ai) answers questions about natural-language state
with typed values: the probability of a yes (Noul), a distribution over named
options (Choice), or a position on described levels (Score). Agents use it for
cheap judgments around their LLM calls; the LLMs keep writing the reports, and
arithmetic, dates and counting stay in code.

Jev is optional. ``jev_client`` returns None when the ``jev`` extra is not
installed, ``TYPESAFE_API_KEY`` is unset, or ``jev_enabled`` is off in the
config, and every caller then behaves as it did without Jev.

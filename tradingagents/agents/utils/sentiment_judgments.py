"""Per-item Jev judgments behind the Sentiment Analyst.

Each news article and social post is judged on its own, in one Jev request that
asks every independent question at once:

- Filter (fit 1 in docs/jev-use-cases.md): is the item about the instrument, is
  it a material event, does it carry instructions aimed at an AI system.
- Score (fit 2): how bullish or bearish it is, what kind of event it reports,
  whether it is opinion rather than a report.

A second request per surviving item asks whether it repeats an item kept
before it from the same source. Which items reach the prompt, and the band,
score and confidence of the report, are then decided in code from those
answers, so a threshold or weight change is an edit to ``SentimentPolicy``
rather than a reworded question.

Jev is not asked to count, compare numbers or read dates: the date window is
applied by the fetchers, and every total, ratio and mean here is arithmetic.

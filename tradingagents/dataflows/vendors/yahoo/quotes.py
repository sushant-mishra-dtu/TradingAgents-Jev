"""Delayed last prices from Yahoo Finance, for the alerts' optional intraday poller.

Yahoo's quotes for NSE and BSE stocks lag the exchange (about 15 minutes), and
nothing here makes them real time: they only let a price alert fire during the
session instead of after the evening's bhavcopy. Nothing else reads them; the
screener, the Company page's figures and the agents keep their own sources.

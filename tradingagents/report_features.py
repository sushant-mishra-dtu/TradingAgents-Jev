"""Jev features from a run's reports, for learning from resolved decisions.

Fit 5 in docs/jev-use-cases.md. A backtest leaves, for every cell, the decision
in its log (settled later with the alpha it earned) and the run's full state on
disk. This asks a fixed set of Jev questions about each report, debate and
decision in that state, turns the answers into numeric columns, and hands them
with the outcomes to ``outcome_model`` to learn whether they predict alpha
better than the rating alone.

- A Score becomes two columns, its expected level and the spread of its level
  distribution; a Noul becomes one, its probability (the encoding of the
  Autoresearch Feature Discovery cookbook).
- One request per document asks all of that document's questions, so each
  request holds one report rather than the whole run.
- Answers are cached on disk by model, question and state, so a new or reworded
  question is the only one asked again when the set changes.

Jev is not asked to compare numbers or dates: the rating, the claim-check flag,
the outcome and every statistic are code.
